To start the temporalize-api server (1st Terminal tab). You shouldn't need to do anything with this. It should never stop:
cd ~/Documents/temporalize-api
npm start

To start the UI server (2nd Terminal tab). This may stop from time to time and you'll have to restart it.
cd ~/Documents/temporalize-api/material-ui/temporalize-ui
npm start

To see available colors in your browser (2nd to last Firefox tab):
file:///Users/cassidyperkins/Documents/temporalize-api/material-ui/docs/build/index.html#/customization/colors

To see YOUR color changes in your browser (last Firefox tab) for the light-raw-theme (which we'll use for AgileCraft):
http://localhost:3000/#/config/themes
Note: if the above address doesn't show the latest color changes then restart the UI server

To see the dark-raw-theme (which we'll use as the starting point for Lumenize) click on the Dark Theme tab.

To edit the light-raw-theme (1st tab in Atom) edit:
/Users/cassidyperkins/Documents/temporalize-api/material-ui/src/styles/raw-themes/light-raw-theme.js

You can only see your changes by editing light-raw-theme. When you get it to the point you like
it and are ready to start working on the agilecraft-raw-theme, then cut and paste
the light-raw-theme contents over to lumenize-raw-theme (second tab in Atom) and save it.

When you are done with the agilecraft-raw-theme, then cut and paste the light-raw-theme over to
agilecraft-raw-theme.js (3rd tab in Atom) and save it.
